# website-portfolio
Created with the help of Midd's "Creating a Simple Website Portfolio" Hack-a-Thon workshop, this is a simple webpage made with the help of Bootstrap. 

In this respitory, the files for the pages of my portfolio website can be found. They can be viewed as a website by utilizing the GitHub environment feature.
