# website-portfolio
Created with the guidance of Michael Linderman through Midd's "Creating a Simple Website Portfolio" Hack-a-Thon workshop, this is a simple website portfolio made through Bootstrap resources. 

In this respitory, the files for the pages of my portfolio website can be found. They can be viewed as a website by utilizing the GitHub pages environment feature.
